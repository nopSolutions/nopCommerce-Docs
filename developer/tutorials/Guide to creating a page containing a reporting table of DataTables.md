# Guide to creating a page containing a reporting table of DataTables
In this tutorial we will be learning about how to extend the functionality of the nopCommerce with custom functionality for admin panel, 
and create a page containing a table with some data as a report. So before starting on this tutorial you need to have some prior 
knowledge and understanding on some of the topics like.

* nopCommerce architecture. (https://docs.nopcommerce.com/developer/tutorials/source-code-organization.html)
* nopCommerce Plugin.
* Entity framework.
* nopCommerce routing.

If you are not familiar with the above topics, we highly recommend you to learn about those first. However, if you are comfortable or at least have some basic understanding on the above topic then you are good enough to continue on this tutorial.

So in this tutorial we will be creating a plugin with a page containing the table displaying information on the distribution of users by country (based on the billing address). Let’s go through the step by step process to create above mentioned functionality.

## Step 1: Create a nopCommerce plugin project.
I am assuming that you already know where and how to create nopcommerce plugin project and configure the project according to nopCommerce standard. If you don’t know then you can visit
https://docs.nopcommerce.com/developer/plugins/how-to-write-plugin_4.20.html link to know how to create and configure nopcommerce plugin project.

If you have followed the above provided link to create and configure your plugin project then you may end up with the folder structure like this.

![image1](_static/Guide-to-creating-a-page-containing-a-reporting-table-of-DataTables/image1.png)

And you also know what kinds of files each of these folder/directory holds. Here “DistOfCustBuCountryPlugin.cs” file is the one that inherent from BasePlugin class. Here is the basic code we want in this file for the sake of this tutorial.


```cs
public class DistOfCustByCountryPlugin: BasePlugin
    {
        public DistOfCustByCountryPlugin()
        {

        }

        public override void Install()
        {
            //Code you want to run while installing the plugin goes here.
            base.Install();
        }

        public override void Uninstall()
        {
            //Code you want to run while Uninstalling the plugin goes here.
            base.Uninstall();
        }
    } 
```

This class has two overridden methods Install and Uninstall from BasePlugin class. If we want to do something before installing and uninstalling our plugin will put that code before calling the install and uninstall method from base class. For example if our plugin may have to create its own table then we will create that table before we call the install method from base class and likewise we may also want to delete our table from database if users want to uninstall our plugin. In this case we may want to run code to delete tables before calling uninstall method from base class.
First let’s create a model named “CustomersDistrubution” inside Models folder/directory.

## #Models/ CustomersDistrubution.cs 

```cs
public class CustomersDistrubution
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Country based on the billing address.
    /// </summary>
    public string Country { get; set; }
    /// <summary>
    /// Number of customers from specific country.
    /// </summary>
    public int NoOfCustomers { get; set; }
}
```
nopCommerce uses the repository pattern for data access which is ideal for dependency injection mechanism. Now let us create a service that fetch required data from database. For service we will create an Interface and create a service class implementing that interface.

## #Services/ ICustomersByCountry.cs
```cs
public interface ICustomersByCountry
{
    List<CustomersDistrubution> GetCustomersDistributionByCountry();
}
```
Here we have only one method description since for the sake of this plugin we do not need any other methods. 

## #Services/ CustomersByCountry.cs
```cs
public class CustomersByCountry : ICustomersByCountry
{
    private readonly CustomerService _custService;
    private readonly StoreService _storeService;
    public CustomersByCountry(CustomerService custService, StoreService storeService)
    {
        _custService = custService;
        _storeService = storeService;
    }
    public List<CustomersDistrubution> GetCustomersDistributionByCountry()
    {
            
        return _custService.GetAllCustomers()
                    .Where(c => c.ShippingAddress != null)
                    .Select(c => new {
                        c.BillingAddress.Country,
                        c.Username
                    })
                    .GroupBy(c => c.Username)
                    .Select(cbc => new CustomersDistrubution()
                    {
                        Country = cbc.Key,
                        NoOfCustomers = cbc.Count()
                    }).ToList();
    }
}
```

Here we are creating a class named “CustomersByCountry” which is inherent from “ICustomersByCountry” interface. Also, we are implementing the method that retrieves data from the database. We used this approach so that we can use dependency injection techniques to inject this service to the controller.
Now let's create a controller class. A good practice to name plugin controllers is like {Group}{Name}Controller.cs. For example, TutorialCustomersByCountryController, here {Tutorial}{CustomersByCountry}Controller. But remember that it is not a requirement to name the controller with {Group}{Name} it is just recommended way by nopcommerce for naming convention but the Controller part in the is the requirement of .Net MVC.

## #Controllers/CustomersByCountryController.cs
```cs
[AuthorizeAdmin] //confirms access to the admin panel
[Area(AreaNames.Admin)] //specifies the area containing a controller or action
public class TutorialCustomersByCountryController: BasePluginController
{
    private ICustomersByCountry _service;
    public TutorialCustomersByCountryController(ICustomersByCountry service)
    {
        _service = service;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult Configuration()
    {
        CustomersByCountrySearchModel customerSearchModel = new CustomersByCountrySearchModel()
        {
            AvailablePageSizes = "10"
        };
        return View("~/Plugins/Tutorial.DistOfCustByCountry/Views/Configure.cshtml", customerSearchModel);
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult GetCustomersCountByCountry ()
    {
        try
        {
            return Ok(new DataTablesModel{ Data = _service.GetCustomersDistributionByCountry() });
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            return BadRequest(ex);
        }
    }
}
```

In the controller we are injecting “ICustomersByCountry” service we created previously to get data from database. Here we have created two Actions one is of type “HttpGet” and another of type “HttpPost”. The “Configure” HttpGet action is returning a view named “Configure.cshtml” which we haven’t created yet. And GetCustomersCountByCountry HttpPost action which is using injected service to retrieve data and returning data in the json format. This action is going to be called by data table which expects response as DataTablesModel object. However, here we are setting the data property which is actually the data which will be rendered in the table.
Now let’s create a view with datatable where we can display our data which then can be view by our users. As well as a _ViewImports.cshtml file which contains code to import all required references for our view files.

## #Views/ Configure.cshtml
```cs
@{
    Layout = "_ConfigurePlugin";
}

@await Html.PartialAsync("Table", new DataTablesModel
{
    Name = "customersDistributionByCountry-grid",
    UrlRead = new     DataUrl(@Html.Raw(Url.Action("GetCustomersCountByCountry", "TutorialCustomersByCountry")).ToString()),
    Paging = false,
    ColumnCollection = new List<ColumnProperty>
     {
         new ColumnProperty(nameof(CustomersDistribution.Country))
         {
             Title = "Country",
             Width = "300"
        },
         new ColumnProperty(nameof(CustomersDistribution.NoOfCustomers))
         {
             Title = "Number Of Customers",
             Width = "100"
        }
     }
})
```

## #Views/_ViewImports.cshtml
```cs
@inherits Nop.Web.Framework.Mvc.Razor.NopRazorPage<TModel>
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
@addTagHelper *, Nop.Web.Framework

@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ViewFeatures
@using Nop.Web.Framework.UI
@using Nop.Web.Framework.Extensions
@using System.Text.Encodings.Web
@using Nop.Plugin.Tutorial.DistOfCustByCountry.Models
@using Nop.Web.Framework.Models.DataTables;
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing;
```

In “Configure.cshtml” we are using a partial view named “Table”. This is the nopcommerce implementation of JQuery Datatable. We can find this file under `Nop.Web/Areas/Admin/Views/Shared/Table.cshtml`. There you can see the code for implementation of datatable. This view model takes DataTablesModel class for configuration of datatable. Let's explain the property we have set for DataTablesModel class.
**Name:** This will be set as a id for datatable.
**UrlRead:** this is the URL from where datatable is going to fetch data to render in table. Here we are setting URL to “GetCustomersCountByCountry” Action of “TutorialCustomersByCountry” Controller from we are getting data for datatable.
**Paging:** This property is used to enable or disable pagination for datatable.
**ColumnCollection:** This property holds the column configuration property.

There are several other properties which you can play around to understand what each properties are used for.

We are almost done but not complete yet. If you have remembered we previously created a service Interface and a service class inheriting that interface and we have injected that service to our controller. But we haven’t yet registered that service to any IOC container. nopCommerce uses AutoFac for dependency injection. So, lets create a class to register the service for dependency injection.

## #Infrastructure/ DependencyRegistrar.cs
```cs
class DependencyRegistrar : IDependencyRegistrar
{
    public int Order => 1;

    public void Register(ContainerBuilder builder, ITypeFinder typeFinder, NopConfig config)
    {
        builder.RegisterType<CustomersByCountry>().As<ICustomersByCountry>().InstancePerLifetimeScope();
    }
}
```
Here we are inheriting from “IDependencyRegistrar” interface which is provided by nopCommerce. Here we need to implement a “Register” Method and an integer property Order. Inside the Register method we register all our service for our plugin as shown in the above code.Under the hood It uses the AutoFac to register our services DependencyRegistrar is just the layer created by nopCommerce which we are using to register our dependencies.

Now the last step is to register our route for the Action “GetCustomersCountByCountry” from Controller “TutorialCustomersByCountry”. We do not need to register the route for “Configure” Action because we have already registered that in `DistOfCustByCountryPlugin` class. 

## #Infrastructure/RouteProvider
```cs
/// <summary>
/// Represents plugin route provider
/// </summary>
public class RouteProvider : IRouteProvider
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Register routes
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="routeBuilder">Route builder</param>
    public void RegisterRoutes(IRouteBuilder routeBuilder)
    {
        //add route for the access token callback
        routeBuilder.MapRoute("CustomersDistributionByCountry", "Plugins/Tutorial/CustomerDistByCountry/",
            new { controller = "TutorialCustomersByCountry", action = "GetCustomersCountByCountry" });
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets a priority of route provider
    /// </summary>
    public int Priority => 0;
}
```

Now just build your project and run. Login as Administrative user and go to LocalPlugins menu under Configuration, there you will see your newly created plugin. Install that plugin. After installation completes you will see a configuration button in your plugin. If you have followed correctly through this tutorial then you will see output something like:
