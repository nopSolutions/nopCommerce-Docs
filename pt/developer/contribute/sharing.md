# Sharing your plugins, themes, and language packs

You can easily upload your plugin or language pack to our [Marketplace](http://www.nopcommerce.com/marketplace.aspx) directory to share it with other users. Just go to [My account](http://www.nopcommerce.com/account.aspx) page, then "Your contributions and extensions" tab. Click "Upload a new extension" button in order to upload a new extension.

And here are some of the benefits of hosting your plugin at the [Marketplace](http://www.nopcommerce.com/marketplace.aspx) directory:

* Track basic statistics regarding how many people are downloading
* Give your plugin greater exposure to the community
* Get your plugin rated against the many other hosted plugins
* Provide a centralized location for users to leave comments and feedback
