# Responsive Design

**Understanding Responsive Design.** Responsive Web Design is simply a design of a website that changes its layout according to different screen sizes in order to fit the content properly when it comes to a desktop, smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices. In this definition, there is a keyword here "properly" â€“ In this context, by "properly", it means consistent. While working on a responsive design, the web developers have to make sure that the user experience of a website remains consistent throughout all the devices, irrespective of their screen size.
