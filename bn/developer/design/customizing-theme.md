# Customizing nopCommerce Themes

## Uploading your store logo

In order to upload your store logo in a nopCommerce website, there are basically 2 methods:

### First Method

Upload your logo through the admin area. See how to do this in the [Uploading your logo](xref:en/getting-started/design-your-store/uploading-your-logo) article.

### Second method

1. Go to nopCommerce root folder `/Themes/YOUR THEME/Content/images/`
1. Look for logo.png image file
1. Replace the `logo.png` with your store logo and name it as `logo.png` (with same width:250px and height:50px)

If you wish to make changes in stylesheet in regard to the logo, look for the following code in your `styles.css`:

```css
.header-logo {
    margin: 0 0 20px;
    text-align: center;
}
.header-logo a {
    display: inline-block;
    max-width: 100%;
    line-height: 0; /*firefox line-height bug fix*/
}
.header-logo a img {
    max-width: 100%;
    opacity: 1;
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You might have to clear the browser cache (or refresh the page using Ctrl+F5 keys) in order to see the changes (new store logo).

    }
    .master-column-wrapper {
        position: relative;
        z-index: 0;
    }
    .master-column-wrapper:after {

        display: block;
        clear: both;
