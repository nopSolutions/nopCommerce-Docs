## Activate the method, edit its name and display order

You can edit the payment method name which will be displayed for customers in the public store or its display order.

In this row you can also activate the plugin or make it inactive using the **Is active** field. Click the **Update** button. Your changes will be saved.

> Instant Payment Notification (IPN) is PayPal's message service that sends a notification when a transaction is affected. Once IPN is integrated, sellers can automate their back office so they are not required to wait for payments to come in to trigger order fulfillment.

## Limit to stores and customer roles

You can limit any payment method to store and customer role. This means that the method will be available to certain stores or customer roles only. You can do this from the *plugin list* page.

1. Go to **Configuration → Local plugins**. Find the plugin you want to limit. In our case it's **PayPal Standard**. To find it faster use the *Search* panel in the top of the page and search by **Plugin name** or by **Group** using the *Payment methods* option.

   ![Plugins](_static/paypal-standard/plugin.jpg)

1. Click the **Edit** button and the *Edit plugin details* window will be displayed, as follows:

   ![Plugins](_static/paypal-standard/edit.jpg)

1. You can set up the following limits:

   - In the **Limited to customer roles** field choose one or several customer roles i.e. administrators, vendors, guests, who will be able to use this plugin. If you don't need this option just leave this field empty.
