# Payment methods

A payment method is how a customer pays for the order. nopCommerce supports both *online* and *offline transactions*. For the online methods, nopCommerce integrates with third-party payment gateways, so that customer's credit card information will be automatically sent through the gateway (as either an authorization or an authorization and charge) upon completion of an order. You can have multiple payment methods active at one time. The customer can select how he/she wants to pay at the checkout.

To define payment methods go to **Configuration â†’  Payment methods**.

> [!TIP]
> 
> By default, there are several payment methods available in nopCommerce, but you can find more payment plugins in the nopCommerce [marketplace](https://www.nopcommerce.com/marketplace).

For the payment method development details, refer to the [document](xref:en/developer/plugins/payment-method).

To activate a payment method, click **Edit** beside the required method, tick the **Is active** checkbox and click **Update**. The **Is active** option changes from *false* to *true*.

 Different payment methods support different options. There are **4 payment options** that can supported by a payment method or not:

* **Supports capture** indicates whether this method allows processing money transfer after the amount was charged.
* **Refund** indicates  this method allows making a money refund after the amount was charged and captured already.
* **Partial refund** indicates whether this method allows making a partial money refund after the amount was charged and captured already.
* **Void** indicates whether this method allows making a money refund before the amount was charged (when the payment status is pending).
* **Recurring support** indicates whether this method allows recurring payments.

Click **Configure** beside a payment method to set it up.
