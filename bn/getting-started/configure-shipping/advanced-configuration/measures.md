# Measures

This section describes how to add new units of weights and dimensions.

To add new dimensions or weights:

Go to **Configuration → Shipping → Measures**. The *Dimensions* and *Weight* sections are expanded, as follows:

![dimensions](_static/measures/dimensions.png)

![weights](_static/measures/weights.png)

In the bottom of the section define the following new unit details:
* **Name** of the new dimension (weight) unit.
* **System keyword** for this unit.
* **Ratio to primary dimension (weight)** unit.
* **Display order** of the measure in the list. A value of 1 represents the top of the list.

Then click **Add new record**.

The new dimension (weight) unit is added to the *Dimensions* (*Weights*) table.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> You can set the primary dimension (weight) by clicking **Mark as primary dimension (weight)**.

Click **Edit** beside the measure to edit its details, as described above.
