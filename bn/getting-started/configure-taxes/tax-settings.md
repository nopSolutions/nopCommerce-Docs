First of all define **common** tax settings:

  * **Shipping address**. When this option is selected, the tax is based on customer shipping address. If the shipping address is unknown, the default address is used (entered below).
  * **Default address**. When this option is selected, the tax is based on the default address that is entered below.
* Choose the **Default tax category** for products. It'll be pre-selected on the *Add new product* page.

In the **Tax displaying** panel you can set up how tax will be displayed for customers:

* Tick the **Hide tax in order summary** checkbox, to hide the tax value in the order summary when prices are shown as tax inclusive.
* Tick the **Force tax exclusion from order subtotal** checkbox, to always exclude tax from the order subtotal (irrelevant to the selected tax display type). This checkbox affects only pages where the order totals are displayed.

In the *Shipping* panel, tick the **Shipping is taxable** checkbox to indicate that the shipping is taxable. The following fields are then displayed:

Then set up VAT in the *VAT* panel:
* Tick the **EU VAT enabled** checkbox, to indicate that European Union Value Added Tax is enabled. When this option is selected, customers will be requested for the *Company VAT number* during registration or on the customer account details page. This VAT number can be automatically validated through a web service, if the **Use web service** checkbox is ticked, or manually on the customer details page in the administration area by the store owner.
* **Your shop country**: from the dropdown list, select the country where your store is located.
* **Allow VAT exemption**: tick this checkbox, to exempt eligible VAT registered customers from VAT.

* **Use web service:** tick this checkbox, to use the web service to validate VAT numbers.
* **Notify admin when a new VAT number is submitted**: tick this checkbox, to receive a notification by email, when a new VAT number is submitted.

> [!NOTE]

> If VAT is enabled, then it charges 0% tax to shipping outside the EU and 0% to those who have supplied a validated and approved VAT number and are shipping within the EU but outside the shop country. Refer to an article for further information on the EU VAT.
