# Uploading favicons

Since the version 4.20 you can automatically upload favicons through the admin area.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> For multistore case you need to repeat this upload procedure for each store.

1. To upload favicons go to **Configuration → Settings → General settings.** The *Favicon and app icons* panel is displayed: 
![settings_block](_static/adding-a-favicon/settings_block.png)

1. Click the green button **Upload icons archive**, the file selection dialog will be opened: ![file_selection_dialog](_static/adding-a-favicon/file_selection_dialog.png) Here you need to copy the path to your icons (it vary depends on the store and the virtual directory). For example: `/icons/icons_0`.

1. There are several options for what to upload, depending on how friendly your site favicons should be for different devices:

   - The most complete option is to use one of the favicon generators. In this manual, we will show an example of using a [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/). Thanks to this service, uploading the full favicon package will be carried out in a few clicks.

      * Go to this generator main page where you will be invited to choose a picture for the favicon 
      ![realfavicongenerator](_static/adding-a-favicon/realfavicongenerator.png)

      * After selecting a picture and clicking **Continue with this picture**, you will be redirected to the next page. Here you can adjust the display settings of favicons for specific devices and applications - iOS Web Clip, Android Chrome, Windows Metro, macOS Safari, etc. The service will automatically show display examples. You can customize them to your needs or leave the default ones.

      * At the bottom of the same page you can find the **Favicon Generator Options** panel. 
      ![favicon_generator_options](_static/adding-a-favicon/favicon_generator_options.png)

         - In this section, you must set certain settings. In the **Path** tab, select the option `I cannot or I do not want to place favicon files at the root of my web site. Instead I will place them here` and specify the path from the step 2. ![favicon_path](_static/adding-a-favicon/favicon_path.png)

         - In the **Version/Refresh** tab, select the option depending on whether your site is already in production. The setting description will help you with this. ![favicon_version](_static/adding-a-favicon/favicon_version.png)

         - In the **Additional files** tab it is necessary to check the option to generate an html file in the package. ![favicon_additional_fields](_static/adding-a-favicon/favicon_additional_fields.png)

      * Now all settings are set, click the button to generate. ![generate_button](_static/adding-a-favicon/generate_button.png)

      * Get your favicon package. ![download_package](_static/adding-a-favicon/download_package.png)

   - The simplest option is to use only **favicon.ico** file, that has been successfully used on many sites for a long time, until devices with different screen resolutions appeared.

      * Find a sample favicon package that is located in `wwwroot/icons/samples/` directory and copy it.

      * In the new package delete all files except **favicon.ico** and **html_code.html**.

      * Replace in this package the file **favicon.ico** with your new favicon.

      * Edit the **html_code.html** file. Leave the only one line there: `<link rel="shortcut icon" href="/icons/icons_0/favicon.ico">`, assuming that `/icons/icons_0` is the path from the step 2.

      * Save these two files into a package. Your favicon package is ready.

   - An intermediate option is using the full favicon package without a generator.

      1. Find a sample favicon package that is located in `wwwroot/icons/samples/` directory and copy it.

      1. Replace the pictures in the new package with your own ones taking into account the original sizes.

      1. Edit the **html_code.html** file, replace all entries of the `/icons/icons_0` with the path that was saved on the step 2.

      1. Save this package. Your favicon package is ready.

1. Return back to the admin area with a prepared favicon package to upload. Select the desired file and click **Upload icons archive**. ![upload_package](_static/adding-a-favicon/file_selection_dialog.png)

1. Ensure your package is successfully uploaded. ![success](_static/adding-a-favicon/success.png)

1. To see the new favicon on the site you should clear cache in the admin area and in the browser then reload the page.

> [!TIP]
> 
> To create a favicon package, you can use any generators, third-party services, or do it manually. The only requirement is the existence of the **html_code.html** file with the html code, which will be placed in the `<head>` element of the site pages.
