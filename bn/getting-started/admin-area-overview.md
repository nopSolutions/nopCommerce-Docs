# nopCommerce interface

This chapter covers the basics of nopCommerce interface.

Once logged in, you should see the **Administration** hyperlink at the top of your website. Or you can simply add `/admin` to the end of your site's URL to open the admin area. For example: `www.example.com/admin`.

The first screen that is displayed after logging in the nopCommerce administration area is the *Dashboard*:

The dashboard has the following sections:

* **nopCommerce news** is a section where important news, sales, and promotions information from nopCommerce are shown.

* **Common statistics** of your webstore which includes numbers of orders, pending return requests, registered customers and low stock products.

* Other sections showing the vital statistics of your webstore: **orders, new customers, order totals, incomplete orders, latest orders, popular search keywords, bestsellers by quantity, bestsellers by amount**:

## Basic and advanced modes

On some pages in the administration area you will see the following switch:

![dashboard5](_static/admin-area-overview/dashboard5.png)

This two-position *Basic-Advanced* switch allows you to switch between page display modes.

For the convenience of use, we made the **Basic** mode where the most frequent settings are shown.

If you cannot find a required setting on a page, switch to the **Advanced** mode to see all available settings.

On some pages, the switch has a **Settings** button beside. You can use it to set up the basic mode according to your needs by adding/removing the required settings.

![dashboard6](_static/admin-area-overview/dashboard6.png)

Click **Settings** to see a list of the available settings. Tick the checkboxes of the **desired setting**. The added settings will then be displayed in the **Basic** mode.
