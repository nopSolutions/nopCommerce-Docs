## Shipment list

The top area of the page enables you to search for a shipment by different search criteria:

* **Start date** and **End date** for shipments created between these dates.
* Enter the **Tracking number** if you want to find shipments with a certain tracking number.
* Select the **Warehouse** for shipments sent from a specific warehouse.
* Click the **Load not delivered** checkbox if you do not want to load already delivered items.
* Use **Country, State/province, County/region, City** to search by a shipment destination.
* Click **Load not shipped** checkbox if you do not want to load already shipped items.

Select certain shipments to **Set as shipped (selected)** or **Set as delivered (selected)**. You can also **Print packaging slips (selected)** or **Print Packaging slips (all)** to print packaging receipts.

In the list of shipments, a store owner can view all items of a shipment by clicking on ![expand](_static/shipping-management/order-shipment-expand.png) in the first column of the shipment.
