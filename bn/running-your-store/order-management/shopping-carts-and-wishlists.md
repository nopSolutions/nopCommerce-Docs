A wishlist is a list of products that a customer can share with friends, or save to transfer to the cart later.

> For example, if a customer adds the same shirt, but in 2 different colors, each shirt appears as a separate item in the wish list. In case the customer adds the same product to the wishlist multiple times, the product appears only once, but with an updated quantity that reflects the number of times the product was added.
