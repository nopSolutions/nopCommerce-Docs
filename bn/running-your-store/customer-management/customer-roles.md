# Customer roles

The customer roles in nopCommerce enable you to form groups of your web store users. You can create various groups such as store admins, shoppers, [vendors](xref:en/running-your-store/vendor-management), and other. You can also grant these groups certain rights such as discounted pricing, and other special statuses (such as tax exemption, free shipping, and more) using the [access control list](xref:en/running-your-store/customer-management/access-control-list).

To manage customer roles go to **Customers â†’ Customer roles**. The *Customer roles* window is displayed, as follows:
