# Activity log

Activity log is used to track user activity in the system. By default, all *activity types* are enabled for tracking in nopCommerce. A store owner can disable them by unticking the relevant checkbox. Most of the activity types listed are only for the administrator, and record actions in the administration area. However, some are for the public store and track actions of shoppers (such as, adding to cart/wishlist, placing an order, etc.).

## Customer activity types

To enable/disable activity types, go to **Customers → Activity types**.

You can clear the certain activity log item by clicking the **Delete** button beside it or you can clear the whole log of activities by clicking the **Clear activity log** button in the top right.
