# Product tags

Product tags are keywords for product identification. They are used to sort the products by a certain feature and to enable a specific, narrow product search.
For example, if you sell apparel, and you want to create tags for T-shirts, it can be "t-shirt", "cotton", "polo", etc.

To edit product tags that are displayed in the public store, go to **Catalog â†’ Product tags**.

On the product tags page, you can see how many products have a certain tag in the **Tagged products** column. You can edit the tag by clicking the **Edit** button beside it. Or you can also delete tags by selecting them and then clicking the **Delete(selected)** button.

## Adding product tags

You can add tags on the Edit product details page when adding or editing a product.

Enter tags separating them by comma. Once the tags are created, they can be used for other products as well. The more products are associated with a particular tag, the larger it will look in the *Popular tags* area, displayed in the sidebar of the catalog page:
