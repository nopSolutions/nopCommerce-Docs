# Import/export products

nopCommerce supports importing from Excel format and exporting products in XML or Excel. You can download products from your catalog in PDF.
You can find these options in **Catalog â†’ Products** at the main page top left.

## Exporting products

 You can export products in XML or Excel formats by clicking the **Export** button. After clicking the **Export** button you will see the dropdown menu enabling you to **Export to XML (all found)** or **Export to XML (selected)** and **Export to Excel (all found)** or **Export to Excel (selected)**.

 If you don't need to download all the products use the *Search* panel to find the required products or/and use checkboxes to select the needed products. A file with products you have chosen will be downloaded. The file consists of all the products characteristics from product editing page panels (Product info, SEO, Pictures and so on).

## Importing products

If you do not want to add all the products to your catalog manually you can use the import option.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Before you start import you should download a table template for import in Excel format as it was described in the [exporting products](#exporting-products) section. For accurate and correct import of your products it's crucial to name all the columns in the table properly (exactly as in the downloaded table).

It is not mandatory to fill all the table fields. The product will be created based on the filled fields.

Imported products are distinguished by SKU. If the SKU already exists, then its corresponding product will be updated.

Import requires a lot of memory resources. That's why it's not recommended to import more than 500 - 1000 records at once. If you have more records, it's better to split them into multiple Excel files and import separately.

### Example

For example, we want to add Dancing shoes to our catalog. Let's create a new row in the table:

![product table](_static/import-export-products/product_table.png)

Then click **Import**, choose the file and click the **Import from Excel** button. Then check if you have a new product in the catalog.
