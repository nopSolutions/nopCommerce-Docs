# Rental products

The rental products functionality is useful when you want to create a website allows customers to book rooms and hotels. This feature is also can be used for a website that offers clothes such as wedding dresses, camping stuff, children toys and more for rent.

## Example

Let's say you wish to create a website provides wedding dresses for rent. 

Which functionality will be useful in this case?

- One of the most important feature is to allow customers to choose *rent period*. In nopCommerce, it is allowed to choose the start date and end date, as on the screenshot below:

- nopCommerce also allows the store administrator to chose *rental period* and *rental period length*. For example, you want to give the wedding dress for rent for 3 days minimum. In this case a customer will see the following on the product details page:

- Use *checkout attributes* to allow a customer to specify return time when a carrier should pick up the dress:
