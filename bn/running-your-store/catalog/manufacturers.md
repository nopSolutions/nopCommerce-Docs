## Importing manufacturers

If you do not want to add all the manufacturers to your catalog manually you can use the import option.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Before you start import you should download a table template for import in Excel format. For accurate and correct import of your manufacturers it's crucial to name all the columns in the table properly (exactly as in the downloaded table).

It is not mandatory to fill all the table fields. The manufacturer will be created based on the filled fields.

Import requires a lot of memory resources. That's why it's not recommended to import more than 500 - 1000 records at once. If you have more records, it's better to split them into multiple Excel files and import separately.
