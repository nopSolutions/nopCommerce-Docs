The "Reward points" program allows customers to earn points for certain actions they take on the site like registering and making purchases.Reward points can be used as one of the payment methods.

Exchangeable reward points can be used together with other payment options such as credit cards, gift cards and more.The points can also be canceled if a customer canceled an order or sent a return request.## Managing reward pointsTo manage the reward points program go **Configuration → Settings → Reward points**.
