# Facebook Pixel plugin

This section describes how to integrate Facebook Pixel in your store.

## What the Facebook Pixel is

Facebook Pixel allows you to receive information about the actions taken on your store to make your Facebook ads more relevant to your audience. Facebook Pixel can help you understand the behaviour of people who visit your store and which advertising strategy works best to reach your business goals.

Tracked conversions appear in the [Facebook Ads Manager](https://www.facebook.com/adsmanager) and in the [Facebook Analytics](https://business.facebook.com/analytics) dashboard, where they can be used to measure the effectiveness of your ads, to define custom audiences for ad targeting, for dynamic ads campaigns, and to analyze the effectiveness of your website's conversion funnels.

## What the Facebook Pixel plugin does

The Facebook Pixel plugin for nopCommerce pasts a snippet of JavaScript code that allows you to track visitor activity on your website. It works by loading a small library of functions which are used whenever a customer takes an action.

## Install and enable the plugin

The Facebook Pixel plugin is an out-of-the-box nopCommerce plugin. You can find it here: **Configuration → Local plugins**. To find the plugin faster use the **Group** field in the search panel to filter the plugins by *Widgets* type:

* Tick the **Enabled** checkbox to enable this Facebook Pixel configuration.
* Enter your **Pixel ID** which you can find in the [Ads Manager → Events Manager](https://business.facebook.com/events_manager). If you have not created a pixel, [follow these instructions](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/952192354843755) to create one - all you need is the pixel's ID.
* **Advanced Matching**: if ticked some of the visitor's data (in the hashed format) will be collected by the Facebook Pixel. If you automatically implement advanced matching using the Events Manager, uncheck this setting.

## Configure custom events

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can see this panel only after you already created and saved current configuration!

If the predefined standard events aren't suitable for your needs, you can track your own custom events, which also can be used to define custom audiences for ad optimization.
You can configure them below. Specify the name and choose widget zones in which the custom event will be tracked. If you don't know which zone to use for your custom event, you can ask about it in our [forums](https://www.nopcommerce.com/boards).
