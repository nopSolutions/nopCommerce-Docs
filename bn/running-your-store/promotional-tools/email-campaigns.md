# Email campaigns

During registration, a customer can select the *Newsletter* option to receive newsletters from your store. Or it's possible to subscribe to a newsletter lately using the form in the footer (in the Default Clean nopCommerce theme). The other way of filling in email subscribers is to import list of subscribers from an external CSV file to nopCommerce. As well as you can export the list of subscribers to an external CSV file from nopCommerce.

See how to manage newsletter subscribers in the [Newsletter subscribers](#newsletter-subscribers) section below.

Use your subscribers list to create email campaigns to easily and quickly reach the target audience without any additional marketing activities. Campaigns help to promote trust and loyalty to a company while also increasing sales.

There are several examples of email marketing campaigns you can use for your store: start with a welcome email that thanks for the subscription, regularly send out announcements, news regarding your company, coupons for future purchasing and much more.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> There are no campaigns available by default, so you can create them from scratch in order to follow your own marketing strategy.

To manage campaigns go to **Promotions → Campaigns**.
