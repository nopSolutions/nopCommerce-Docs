## Low stock report

The low stock report contains a list of products that are currently under stock. In the example shown below, the min stock quantity was set to 20 and the stock quantity is 0, therefore a low stock report is generated for this product. You can set up low stock settings when adding the product.

To view low stock reports, go to **Reports → Low stock**. The *Low stock* report window is displayed, as follows:
![Low stock report](_static/reports/low-stock-reports.png)

The low stock reports could be filtered by the **Published** property, which represents the *Published* property of products.

In the displayed table, click **View** to view the product details page where the stock quantity can be updated.

## Bestsellers and never purchased

Knowing the bestselling products and products never purchased is very important for any shop owner.

First of all, this can help in making better purchasing decisions: you can scale up on your popular items and exclude unpopular ones from your products list. When analyzing, consider, for example, whether certain colors sell faster, or whether your product sales depend on a season.

Secondly, defining most and least selling goods can help you to *re-evaluate product design and marketing*. Maybe your best items go faster just because of their placement in your web store, or because of a better description. Come up with different options and test them. To do it more effectively, engage with your customers. *Conduct different surveys* to find out why the best selling items are preferred, what makes them special for your buyers. Use the insights to improve your marketing and increase sales.
