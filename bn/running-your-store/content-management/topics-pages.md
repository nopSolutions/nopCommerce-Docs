# Topics (pages)

Topics (pages) are free-form content blocks that can be displayed on your site, either embedded within other pages or on a page of their own. These are often used for FAQ pages, policy pages, special instructions, and so on. To create custom page, you should create a new topic and enter your custom page content on the topic details page. Content can be written for each language separately.

## Topic list

To see the topics go to **Content management → Topics (pages)**.
Search for topics in the topics list by entering topic text in the **Search keywords** field (or a part of the topic text), or among all the topics of a certain store.
