# Product management

Products is a **basis of an online store**, and product management is a very important part of your store management strategy. Product information helps customers decide whether they want to purchase an item or not. So make sure to have quality product content on the store, because it builds confidence in your customers that they are getting exactly what they need and expect.

Most important components of the product management in nopCommerce are adding products’ manufacturers, setting up product categories to make navigation easy, adding good product descriptions and appealing pictures, listing all possible product variants, defining product tags to make a product search quick and effective.
