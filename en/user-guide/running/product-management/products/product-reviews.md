# Product reviews

**Product reviews** are customers’ comments on a product. Reviews can also include ratings.

In the public store, reviews are displayed on the **product details page**. Customers can write reviews for different products. After a review has been written and approved by a store owner, other customers can define whether the review was helpful or not by clicking Yes or No beside the review.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> **By default**, the reviews must be approved by the store owner before they appear in the public store. However, in case a store owner decides that reviews do not have to be approved, this default behavior can be changed. To opt out of the obligatory product reviews approval, go to **Configuration → Settings → Catalog Settings** from the menu, and **untick the Product reviews must be approved option**.
