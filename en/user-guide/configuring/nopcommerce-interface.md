This two-position Basic-Advanced switch allows you to switch between page display modes.

For the convenience of use, we made the “Basic” mode where the most frequent settings are shown.

If you cannot find a required setting on a page, switch to the “Advanced” mode to see all available settings.

On some pages, the switch has a **Settings** button beside. You can use it to set up the basic mode according to your needs by adding/removing the required settings.
