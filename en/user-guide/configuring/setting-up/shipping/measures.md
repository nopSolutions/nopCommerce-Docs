# Measures

This section describes how to add new units of weights and dimensions.

**To add new dimensions (weights)**:

Go to **Configuration → Shipping → Measures**. In the Dimensions (Weight) section click **Add new record**. The Dimensions (Weight) section is expanded, as follows:

![dimensions](_static/measures/dimensions.png)

![weights](_static/measures/weights.png)

Define the following new unit details:

* **Name** of the new dimension (weight) unit
* **System keyword** for this unit
* **Ratio to primary dimension (weight)** unit
* **Display order** of the measure in the list. A value of 1 represents the top of the list.

The new dimension (weight) unit is added to the Dimensions (Weights) panel.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> You can set the primary dimension (weight) by clicking Mark as primary dimension (weight).

Click **Edit** beside the measure to edit its details, as described above.
