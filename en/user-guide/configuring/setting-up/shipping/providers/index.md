# Shipping Providers

If you sell shippable products, you will need to set up shipping methods for your store to deliver orders to customers. You can either define your own shipping methods or use the pre-defined shipping methods provided by popular carriers, such as USPS, UPS, and FedEx. nopCommerce has a variety of preinstalled shipment plugins connecting the platform with leading shipping providers, in addition to inbuilt tools for complex shipping calculations, such as shipping by weight and fixed rate shipping.

If you decide to define and use your own shipping methods, the shipping rates for these methods should be entered manually. If you decide to use the shipping methods provided by the carrier companies like USPS, UPS or FedEx, the shipping rates for these methods will need to be obtained from the respective carrier companies.

**All shipment options are implemented as plugins** and can be found and installed in Plugins section (**Configuration → Plugins → Local plugins**).

Learn how to set up the required shipment options in the following chapters:
