# Configuring code style

Certain coding guidelines exist in a company nopCommerce, one has to follow these guidelines when creating source code. Visual Studio 2019 helps to maintain the necessary style of code using the [.editorconfig](https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/blob/develop/.editorconfig) file.

> [!TIP]
