## 1. Supported Browsers

* Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 and above (IE6 and IE7 were supported in versions prior 3.60, IE8 was support in versions prior 4.10)
* Mozilla Firefox 2.0 and above
* Google Chrome 1.x
* Apple Safari 2.x

## 2. Tools Required for Development

Since it is based on Microsoft's .NET 7 we need to install a few tools before starting developing on top of nopCommerce.

### .NET 7 runtime & .NET 7 SDK

Since nopCommerce 4.60 is based on .NET 7. We need to install [.NET 7 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-aspnetcore-7.0.3-windows-x64-installer) and [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-7.0.201-windows-x64-installer) before we start development on nopCommerce.

### Visual Studio 2022 or Above / Visual Studio Code

As we know, nopCommerce is based on "Microsoft .NET 7" and *Visual Studio IDE* is best for developing .Net based applications. Since .NET Core is platform independent, we can develop and deploy a .Net based application on any platform. But we can use *Visual Studio Code* as an alternative to *Visual Studio* for developing on Windows as well as other platforms.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you are using *Visual Studio Code*, you will need to install the **C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp)** extension.

### Microsoft SQL Server 2012 or Above / MySql Server 5.7 or Above / PostgreSQL 9.2 or Above

Started from 4.30 version nopCommerce uses Linq2DB as an ORM Framework. Linq2DB  is an object-relational mapper (ORM) that enables .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects. It can map .Net objects to various numbers of Database providers. And you may choose between MS SQL Server, MySql server and PostgreSQL.

### Internet Information Service (IIS) 7.0 or above

For hosting nopCommerce app/project we can use IIS. Which is Microsoft technology used to host Microsoft web based applications on windows. But you are not limited for hosting your nopCommerce in windows only you can host nopCommerce in Linux and MacOS too. As you may know you that IIS is not supported in other platform then windows. So, you can use other tools like Apache or Nginx to host your application on Linux server.
