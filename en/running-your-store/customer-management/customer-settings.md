To define customer settings, go to **Configuration → Settings → Customer settings**. The customer settings window will be displayed. This window contains six panels: Common, Password and security, Account, Profile, Customer form fields, and Address form fields.

1. The **Common** panel contains general customer settings.

1. The **Account** panel contains fields for setting up a customer account.

1. The **Profile** panel contains fields for configuring the customer profile.

1. The **Customer form fields** panel contains fields that are used on the customer registration page.

1. The **Address form fields** panel contains fields for detailing the customer's address during checkout.

Define the common customer settings as follows:
* Select the **Registration method** as follows:
  * **Standard account creation**: users are enabled to register; no approval is required.
  * **Email validation is required after registration**: users are enabled to register; however, they must accept the confirmation email sent to them before their account is approved.
  * **A customer should be approved by administrator**: users are enabled to register; administrator approval is required.

This feature is potentially not safe, and CAPTCHA is needed to prevent and complicate brute force. For more details, refer to the [CAPTCHA settings](xref:en/getting-started/advanced-configuration/security-settings#captcha).
