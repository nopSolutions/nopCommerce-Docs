# Online customers

The Online customers section enables store owners to view customers that were online within the last 20 minutes. This information is useful for store owners as it shows the last visited page and helps to decide upon actions required to convert visitors into buyers.

To access this window, go to **Customers → Online customers**.

- **Location** — IP-address-wise location of the customer.
- **Last activity** — date and time the online customer last logged in.
