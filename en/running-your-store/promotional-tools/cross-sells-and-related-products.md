# Cross-sells and related products

"Cross-sells" and "Related products" are marketing tools in nopCommerce that can be used to offer your customers additional products they may like based on their shopping behavior (viewing and adding certain products to the cart). It is also a good opportunity for you to up-sell some products. You can use both these tools simultaneously.

You can set up cross-sells and related products when creating or editing a product on the product edit page. Go to **Catalog → Products**, select a product, and click **Edit**. Find the *Cross-sells* and *Related products* panels.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You need to save the product before you can add cross-sells and related products.

## Cross-sells

The "cross-sell products" option provides an opportunity to sell additional products that are usually bought with the selected product; however, you can add any product from your catalog, even those not complementary to the product in the cart. Cross-sells are displayed at the bottom of the checkout page. For example, when your customer is buying a CPU, they might need a monitor and something else. You can add an unlimited number of cross-sell products to a product.
