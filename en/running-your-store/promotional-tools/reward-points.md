# Reward points

The **Reward Points** functionality enables you to create and implement loyalty program for improving customer experience and increase customer loyalty. The Reward Points Program allows customers to earn points for certain actions they take on the site like registering and making purchases.

Reward points can be used as one of the **payment methods.** This option is displayed in the **Payment Method area of the checkout**. Exchangeable reward points can be used together with other payment methods such as credit cards, gift cards and more.

The points can also be canceled if a customer canceled an order or sent a return request.
