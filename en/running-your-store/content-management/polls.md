# Polls

You can use **Polls functionality** in nopCommerce to make your e-commerce site more interactive. There are many ways you can use polls for an e-commerce site. One popular way is to use them as a short customer satisfaction survey. People like being asked for a feedback and this is a good opportunity to see how you are doing as an online merchant.

To view all the polls and add new ones go to **Content management → Polls**
