# Forums

A forum is an online discussion site where people can hold conversations in the form of posted messages. A forum may contain a number of subforums, each having several topics.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> In nopCommerce, forums are disabled by default. To enable forums, go to **Configuration → Settings → Forum settings** and select the **Forums enabled** checkbox. The "Forums" link should be displayed in the menu in the public store (top menu or footer in the default theme).

To manage forum groups and forums (inside forum groups), go to **Content management → Forums**.

## Forum settings

To access forum settings, go to **Configuration → Settings → Forum settings**. This page is available in 2 modes: *advanced* and *basic*.

This page enables multi-store configuration; it means that the same settings can be defined for all stores or differ from store to store. If you want to manage settings for a certain store, choose its name from the multi-store configuration dropdown list and select all the checkboxes needed on the left to set custom values for them. For further details, refer to [Multi-store](xref:en/getting-started/advanced-configuration/multi-store).
