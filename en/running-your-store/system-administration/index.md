# System administration

This chapter covers the technical aspects of running a nopCommerce store. It describes how to expand the store functionality by technical means, such as additional external plugins, external authentication for easier checkout process, configuration of widgets, and setting up email accounts.

This chapter focuses more on the back end; the front end is covered in the [Design](xref:en/getting-started/design-your-store/index) chapter.
