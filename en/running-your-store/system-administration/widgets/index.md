# Widgets

A widget (or control) is an element of a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays information that can be changed by a user. nopCommerce has several built-in widget plugins, for example, Google Analytics or Nivo Slider. A list of available widget plugins is displayed in the grid (on the pictured below). When adding a widget you should select a widget zone. The widget zone is a part of UI (user-interface) in the public store where this widget will be displayed or rendered.

> For example, you can place Live Person chat widget on the left column or on the right column.
