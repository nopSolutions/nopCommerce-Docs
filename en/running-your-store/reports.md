# Reports

Reports are important for management; they allow for monitoring store's performance, tracking key metrics, and supporting decision-making. nopCommerce reports provide access to sales and customer information.

## Dashboard

The dashboard is the first page you see when accessing the admin area. It enables you to view your store statistics, including the total number of orders processed over the chosen period (year, month, week), registered customers, low-stock products, and the most popular products in your store.

## Sales summary

This report represents the total orders summary. To generate a report, you can use the following filters:

- **Start date** for the search.
- **End date** for the search.
- **Order status** to search by a specific order status, for example, "Complete."
- **Payment status** to search by a specific payment status, for example, "Paid."
- **Category** to search in a specific category.
- **Manufacturer** to search by a specific manufacturer.
- **Billing country** to filter by order billing country.
- **Product** to search by a specific product.
- **Group by** for grouping by time periods. When this option is set to "Day," it will display a list of dates for a selected period (start/end date). For example, "Nov 8th, 2020," "Nov 7th, 2020," etc. When it is set to "Week", it will display a list of weeks (for example, "December 7th, 2020 - December 12th, 2020," etc.). When it is set to "Month", it will display a list of months (for example, "December 2020," "November 2020," etc.).

Then click **Run report**.

## Low stock report

A low stock report contains a list of products currently under stock. In the example shown below, the min stock quantity was set to 20, and the stock quantity is 0; therefore a low stock report is generated for this product. You can set up low stock settings when adding the product.

To view low stock reports, go to **Reports → Low stock**. The *Low stock* report window will be displayed as follows:
![Low stock report](_static/reports/low-stock-reports.png)

The low stock reports can be filtered by the **Published** property, which represents the *Published* property of products.

In the displayed table, click **View** to view the product details page where the stock quantity can be updated.

## Bestsellers and never purchased

Knowing the best-selling products and products never purchased is essential for any shop owner.

First of all, this can help in making better purchasing decisions: you can scale up on your popular items and exclude unpopular ones from your product list. When analyzing, consider, for example, whether certain colors sell faster or whether your product sales depend on a season.

Secondly, defining most and least selling goods can help you *re-evaluate product design and marketing*. Maybe your best items go faster just because of their placement in your webstore or better description. Come up with various options and test them. To do it more effectively, engage with your customers. *Conduct various surveys* to find out why the best-selling items are preferred, what makes them special for your buyers. Use the insights to improve your marketing and increase sales.
