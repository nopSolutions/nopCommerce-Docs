# Full-text search based on Lucene

Please get the Full-Text Search plugin based on Lucene [here](https://www.nopcommerce.com/full-text-search-lucene?utm_source=docs.nopcommerce&utm_medium=documentation&utm_campaign=full-text-search-lucene).

[Apache Lucene™](https://lucene.apache.org/) is a high-performance, full-featured search engine library written entirely in Java. It is a technology suitable for nearly any application that requires structured search, full-text search, faceting, nearest-neighbor search across high-dimensionality vectors, spell correction, or query suggestions.

Our integration uses [Lucene.Net](https://lucenenet.apache.org/) which is a port of the Lucene search library. Apache Lucene.NET is a .NET library providing powerful indexing, search features, and advanced analysis/tokenization capabilities.

## Available features

Here is a list of supported features:

* Automatic updating of product data in the stored index.
* Automatic matching of the available indexing language to the current store language.
* Several built-in search types:
  * Fuzzy search is used for the phrases that are spelled incorrectly. For example, when you type ‘test’ instead of ‘text’, results still can be found.
  * Wildcard search is used for matching phrase patterns instead of searching full phrases. The integration uses the `*` wildcard operator to represent word endings.
  * Exact search strictly matches the query to indexed tokens.

## Plugin configuration

Click the **Configure** button beside the Lucene search provider option in the list. Next, follow the steps to complete configuring the plugin:

![Lucene configuration page](_static/lucene-config-page.png)

1. Choose a search algorithm:
    * The "**Fuzzy**" search is based on the Levenshtein Distance (For example, searches for a "roam" term will find terms like "foam" and "roams").
    * The "**Contains**" search looks for 0 or more characters based on the wildcard searches with "*" at the end (For example, to search for "test", "tests", or "tester", you can use the "test" term).
    * The "**None**" option is based on exact matching.
1. Choose a rule for matching terms in a search query:
    * The "**Should**" operator - terms should appear in a field of the matching product, but are optional
    * The "**Must**" operator - terms must appear in a field of the matching product.
1. Set up the behavior of updating the search index documents. Check the **Immediately update indexes** to immediately apply changes for the mapped product (for example, their names or descriptions were changed). Otherwise, the reindexing will be scheduled.
    > [!NOTE]
    > You may also manually click the "Rebuild index" button to start reindexing.
1. Enter the **Result limit**, if necessary. The Result limit is the maximum number of result matches that will be retrieved from the index for search queries.
1. Enter additional delimiter characters to split a search query into terms. Please note that search queries are always splitted by space, in addition to the entered delimiters.
1. Click the **Save** button

> [!NOTE]
> To toggle the plugin state, use the "**Enable**" or "**Disable**" buttons. They are displayed depending on the current state.
