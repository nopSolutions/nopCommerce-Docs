# Product reviews

Product reviews are customers' comments on a product. Reviews can also include ratings.

In the public store, reviews are displayed on the product details page. Customers can write reviews for various products. After a review has been written and approved by a store owner, other customers can define whether the review is helpful or not by clicking *Yes* or *No* beside the review.

> [!NOTE]
>
> By default, the reviews must be approved by the store owner before they appear in the public store. However, in case a store owner decides that reviews do not have to be approved, this default behavior can be changed. To opt out of the obligatory product reviews' approval, go to **Configuration → Settings → Catalog settings** and clear the **Product reviews must be approved** option.

## Managing product reviews

To manage product reviews, go to **Catalog → Product reviews**. The *Product reviews* window will be displayed as follows:
