# Add products

Setting up products in the best way possible is crucial for a store. Make sure to miss no detail, such as displaying various size and color options, giving thorough product descriptions, adding appealing pictures.

To add a new product, go to **Catalog → Products**. Click **Add new** button in the top right corner.

Once you have a list of products, you can export it to an external file for backup purposes, by clicking the **Export** button. After clicking the **Export** button, you will see the dropdown menu enabling you to **Export to XML (all found)** or **Export to XML (selected)** and **Export to Excel (all found)** or **Export to Excel (selected)**. Additionally, it is possible to **Download catalog as PDF** to print the selected products into a PDF file. To remove products from the list, select the items to be deleted and click the **Delete (selected)** button.

The *Add a new product* page is available in two modes: **advanced** and **basic** (advanced mode by default). You can switch to the basic mode, which only displays the required fields.

- Use the **Weight adjustment** field to specify the weight adjustment applied when choosing this attribute value.

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > All other applied discounts will be ignored when this field is specified.
- In **Notify admin for quantity below**, enter the quantity below which the admin will be notified.
