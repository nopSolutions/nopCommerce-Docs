## Wishlist

Select the *Wishlist* option from the **Shopping cart type** dropdown list on the **Sales → Shopping carts and wishlists** page and click **Search** to view the wishlists.

A wishlist is a list of products that a customer can share with friends or save to transfer to the cart later. If adding to wishlist is enabled for a product, the **Add to wishlist** button appears on the product details page in the public store. When a product of different variants is added to a wishlist, all variants chosen by the customer will be included in the wishlist.

> [!TIP]
>
> For example, if a customer adds the same shirt in 2 different colors, each shirt will appear as a separate item in the wishlist. In the case a customer adds the same product to the wishlist multiple times, the product only appears once but with an updated quantity that reflects the number of times it was added.

The following screenshot illustrates how a customer sees the wishlist page in the public store:
![Wishlist public](_static/shopping-carts-and-wishlists/wishlist-public.jpg)

There are a few elements on the wishlist page:

1. The button in the **Remove** column allows removing an item from the wishlist.
1. The **Update wishlist** button allows a customer to change a product's quantity by entering the appropriate number in the **Qty** field.
1. The **Add to cart** button allows a customer to add the selected products to the cart.
1. The **Email a friend** button allows a customer to send the wishlist to a friend via email. You can disable this by clearing the **Allow customers to email their wishlists** checkbox on the **Configuration → Settings → Shopping cart settings** page.
1. **Your wishlist URL for sharing** allows a customer to share the wishlist.

> [!NOTE]

> In case you don't want to allow a customer to add a certain product to wishlist, select the **Disable wishlist button** checkbox in the *Prices* panel of the product edit page. Read more about adding a product in the [Add products](xref:en/running-your-store/catalog/products/add-products) chapter.
