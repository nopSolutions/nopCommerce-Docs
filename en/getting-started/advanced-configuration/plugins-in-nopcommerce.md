# Plugins in nopCommerce

Plugins are a set of components adding specific capabilities to a nopCommerce store. Examples of plugins include payment modules, shipping rate computation methods, and more. This section describes how to install plugins manually.

nopCommerce [marketplace](http://www.nopcommerce.com/marketplace) has a variety of plugins expanding your store functions. Plugins can be installed either by downloading from the marketplace or accessing the storefront directly from the admin panel.

The plugins on the marketplace can be sorted by category, version, name or rating and can be free or paid.

The plugins available on the marketplace are developed by the nopCommerce team, solution partners or third-party vendors.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Plugins labeled "By nopCommerce team" are developed by the nopCommerce team and distributed freely. Third-party services connectors are developed within the *technology partnership program*; they are subject to the nopCommerce [premium support services](http://www.nopcommerce.com/nopcommerce-premium-support-services) and distributed freely as well.
