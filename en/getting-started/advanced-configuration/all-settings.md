# All settings

*All settings* is an advanced tool for modifying all settings of the site on a single screen. For example, you have multiple stores and need to create an exact copy of the first store setting-wise. Then, doing all the changes on a single screen with the help of *All settings* can save you a lot of time.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Modifying the settings in this window is only recommended for advanced users. It is not recommended to modify these settings unless the user knows the system very well.

To define the settings:

Go to **Configuration → Settings → All settings (advanced)**. The *All settings (advanced)* window will be displayed:
