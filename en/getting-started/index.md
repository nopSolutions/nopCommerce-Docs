## 2. Create a catalog and add products

A catalog is what your customers constantly deal with. That is why it is crucial to make it easy to browse and find needed products.

### Create categories and manufacturers

Categories and manufacturers  will be used in your catalog for product filtering. Learn how to deal with them and make the site navigation easier.

### Add products

You can add products manually one by one or import your catalog from an xml file.

### Define product variations

What if your products are variable, for example, you sell sneakers in different colors and sizes? In nopCommerce you can set up specification and product attributes to manage this.

## 3. Improve customer experience in your store

Now when your catalog is filled with products, ensure that your customers are able to get all the needed support on their journey to a purchase.

### Product reviews

Personal buying experience counts. It makes people trust you as a seller more. Learn how to make product reviews available for your online store and manage them here.

### Livechat support

Often your customers need to ask a question right here and right now. Livechat option can be a good way to help them. Find chat plugins in nopCommerce marketplace.

### Wishlists

A wishlist is a good option for deferred purchasing. Let your customers add some products to wishlist to buy them later or to share with friends. It is also a good option for you to analyze your customers behavior.
