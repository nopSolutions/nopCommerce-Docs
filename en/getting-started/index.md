# Getting started

If you are a novice in nopCommerce, follow the steps below to set up and run your store:

## 1. Configure your store

- [Configure general store settings](xref:en/getting-started/advanced-configuration/your-store-information)
- [Configure payment methods](xref:en/getting-started/configure-payments/payment-methods/index)
- [Configure shipping options](xref:en/getting-started/configure-shipping/index)
- Configure users list: create [different groups](xref:en/running-your-store/customer-management/customer-roles) of users, give them [separate access to the areas of your site](xref:en/running-your-store/customer-management/access-control-list) and offers, and more.

## 2. Create a catalog and add products

A catalog is what your customers constantly deal with. That's why it is crucial to make it easy to browse and find the products needed.

### Create categories and manufacturers

Categories and manufacturers  will be used in your catalog for product filtering. Learn how to deal with them to make the site navigation easier.

- [Manufacturers](xref:en/running-your-store/catalog/manufacturers)

### Add products

You can add products manually one by one or import your catalog from an xml file.

- [Products](xref:en/running-your-store/catalog/products/index)

### Define product variations

What if your products are variable, for example, you sell sneakers in various colors and sizes? In nopCommerce you can set up specification and product attributes to manage this.

## 3. Improve customer experience in your store

Now that your catalog is filled with products, ensure that your customers get all the support needed on their journey to a purchase.

### Product reviews

Personal buying experience counts. It gives people more trust in you as a seller. Learn here how to make product reviews available for your online store and manage them.

### LiveChat support

Often your customers need to ask a question right here and right now. The LiveChat option can be a good way to help them. Find chat plugins in the nopCommerce marketplace.

### Wishlists

A wishlist is a good option for deferred purchasing. Let your customers add some products to wishlist to buy them later or share with friends. It is also a good option for you to analyze your customers' behaviors.
