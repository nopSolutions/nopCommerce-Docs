# Pickup points

Pickup point is an option providing customers the flexibility to select where they can receive parcels.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> This option is only available when the checkbox **"Pick up in store" enabled** is selected on the shipping settings page (**Configuration → Settings → Shipping settings**).

To manage pickup point providers:

Go to **Configuration → Shipping → Pickup points**; the *Pickup point providers* page will be displayed:

![Pickup point providers](_static/pickup-points/pickup-point-providers.jpg)

By default, only one **Pickup in store** option is available. Make sure the pickup point provider is active. If not click the **Edit** button and select the checkbox in the **Is active** column. Then save the changes by clicking the **Update** button.

To edit existing pickup points or add new ones, click **Configure** in the grid. The *Configure - Pickup in store* page will be opened:

![Pickup point configure](_static/pickup-points/pickup-in-store-configure.png)

Click **Add a new pickup point**; the *Add new* window will be displayed:

* **Address 1**.
* **Zip/postal code**.
* Pickup point's **Opening hours**.
* **Pickup fee** if needed.
* **Display order** of this pickup point.
