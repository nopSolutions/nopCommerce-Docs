# Tax providers

To define tax rate providers go to **Configuration → Tax providers**.

Only one tax rate provider can be used for tax calculation. Adding new tax providers is only recommended for advanced users.
To select the default tax provider click the **Mark as primary provider** button.

> [!TIP]
>
> By default, there are several tax providers available in nopCommerce, but you can find more tax providers in the nopCommerce [marketplace](https://www.nopcommerce.com/marketplace).

The configuration of tax providers is described in the following chapters:

* [Avalara tax provider](xref:en/getting-started/configure-taxes/tax-providers/avalara)
* [Manual (fixed or by country/state/zip)](xref:en/getting-started/configure-taxes/tax-providers/manual)
