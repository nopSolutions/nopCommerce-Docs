# External authentication methods

External authentication methods allow users to login to a nopCommerce site without entering their credentials: email and password. Users can be authenticated using an external site (such as  Facebook, Google, and so on). nopCommerce has a built-in external authentication through Facebook. You can set up other methods using plugins from the [marketplace](https://www.nopcommerce.com/marketplace).

After an external authentication method is configured and marked as active, users will see a new authentication option on the login page.

## Manage the external authentication methods

Go to **Configuration → Authentication → External authentication**. The *External authentication* window is displayed:

Click **Edit** beside an authentication method and tick **Is active** to activate the method. You can also define the method **Display order**. Then click the **Update** button to save the changes.

Click **Configure** for the method configuration.
