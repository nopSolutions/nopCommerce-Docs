# Sharing your plugins and themes

You can easily upload your plugin to our [Marketplace](http://www.nopcommerce.com/marketplace) directory to share it with other users. Just go to [My account](http://www.nopcommerce.com/customer/info) page, then "Your extensions" tab. Click "Upload a new extension" button in order to upload a new extension.

And here are some of the benefits of hosting your plugin at the [Marketplace](http://www.nopcommerce.com/marketplace) directory:

* Track basic statistics regarding how many people are downloading
* Give your plugin greater exposure to the community
* Get your plugin rated against the many other hosted plugins
* Provide a centralized location for users to leave comments and feedback

nopCommerce team examines each extension for quality and to make sure that it meets all our requirements (including the documentation and images). If your submission does not pass our reviews, we will tell you why, and how to fix it. Otherwise, your successful submissions will be listed on our marketplace.

Please find a complete list of our requirements and information about the review process [here](https://www.nopcommerce.com/submitting-plugins-to-nopcommerce-marketplace).
