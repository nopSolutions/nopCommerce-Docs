# Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection

Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection are two related ways to break apart dependencies in your applications. [Inversion of Control (IoC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) means that objects do not create other objects on which they rely to do their work. Instead, they get the objects that they need from an outside source. [Dependency Injection (DI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) means that this is done without the object intervention, usually by a framework component that passes constructor parameters and sets properties. Martin Fowler has written a great description of Dependency Injection or Inversion of Control. I'm not going to duplicate his work, and you can find his article [here](https://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html). nopCommerce uses ASP.NET Core's built-in DI container, which is represented by the `IServiceProvider` interface. This container is responsible for mapping dependencies to specific types and for injecting dependencies into various objects. Once a service and an appropriate interface, which the service implements, are written you should register them in any class implementing the `IDependencyRegistrar` interface (`Nop.Core.Infrastructure.DependencyManagement` namespace). For example, all core nopCommerce services are registered in the **DependencyRegistrar** class located in the `Nop.Web.Framework` library.

```csharp
    public class DependencyRegistrar : IDependencyRegistrar
    {
        public virtual void Register(IServiceCollection services, ITypeFinder typeFinder, NopConfig config)
        {
                services.AddScoped<IWebHelper, WebHelper>();
            ...
        }
    }
```

You can create as many dependency registrar classes as you need. Each class implementing **IDependencyRegistrar** interface has an **Order** property. It allows you to replace existing dependencies. To override nopCommerce dependencies, set the `Order` property to something greater than 0. nopCommerce orders dependency classes and runs them in ascending order. The higher the number the later your objects will be registered.
