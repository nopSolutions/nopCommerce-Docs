# Configuring code style

Certain coding guidelines exist in a company nopCommerce, one has to follow these guidelines when creating source code. Visual Studio 2019 helps to maintain the necessary style of code using the [.editorconfig](https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/blob/develop/.editorconfig) file.

> [!TIP] More information about this subject can be found by reading the documentation "[Code style preferences](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/code-styles-and-code-cleanup?view=vs-2019)"
