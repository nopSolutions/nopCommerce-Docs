# Email campaigns

During customer registration, a customer can select the **Newsletters option** to receive nopCommerce newsletters.

Use your subscribers list to create email campaigns to easily and quickly reach target audience without any additional marketing activities. Campaigns help to promote trust and loyalty to a company while also increasing sales.

There are several examples of email marketing campaigns you can use for your store: start with a welcome email that thanks for the subscription, regularly send out announcements, news regarding your company, coupons for future purchasing and much more.
