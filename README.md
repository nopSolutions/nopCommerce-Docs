# nopCommerce Documentation

This repository was created in order to help set up and configure your store, fill it with content, and run an online business more easily. It provides all the necessary information to implement and use nopCommerce features.

The user guides describe the step-by-step process of deploying the online store. The guides take you through the steps from installing nopCommerce to promoting your shop, with examples on how all the features can be used to complete real business tasks. 

The documentation portal is hosted at [docs.nopCommerce.com](https://docs.nopCommerce.com). See the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [issues list](https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce-Docs/issues) if you would like to help out.
