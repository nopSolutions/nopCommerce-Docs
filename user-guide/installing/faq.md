## Why choose nopCommerce?

## Error Message: "We're sorry, an internal error occurred. Our supporting staff has been notified of this error and will address the issue shortly..."

For versions 4.00 and above version to find out what went wrong you need to turn off the custom errors mode.

1. Open `appsettings.json` file
1. Find out the following line "DisplayFullErrorStack": false,
1. Replace it with "DisplayFullErrorStack": true
1. Restart the site

Also, check Admin → System → Log for any errors.

Also, you can enable "stdoutLogEnabled" (set to "true") in your web.config. Then you'll see a detailed error at the `\logs\` directory

For versions below 4.00 version to find out what went wrong you need to turn off the custom errors mode.

1. Open web.config file
2. Find out the following line `<customErrors defaultRedirect="errorpage.htm" mode="RemoteOnly">`
3. Replace it with `<customErrors defaultRedirect="errorpage.htm" mode="Off">`
Also, check Admin → System → Log for any errors.

## Why does my home page take so long to load?

Large ASP.NET apps take a while to initially load into memory.  Once loaded, the ASP app pool will unload your app if it goes idle (20 minutes by default).  Check that the KeepAlive scheduled task is running (Admin → System → Scheduled Tasks) and consider using a 3rd party monitor, and keep alive. Alternatively, to see what is causing delay in loading pages you can enable Mini-Profiler available in the nopCommerce. To enable the same, You can go into the admin area → Configuration → Advanced Setting, and search for the Setting with name "DisplayMiniProfilerInPublicStore". Enable this setting. This will turn on a Mini Profiler, which will display time it took to generate page with information on which operation is taking what time.

## Users are logged out frequently

Adding a machine key to the web.config file should fix the problem of being logged out. You can generate the machine key or read more about it [here](https://www.developerfusion.com/tools/generatemachinekey/) or [here](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/16645/ASP-NET-machineKey-Generator)

If you have access to the database  (using a tool like SSMS, etc) then un-delete the user:

```SQL
update Customer
set Deleted = 0
where Id = 1
```

(Typically the Id for Admin is 1, but if not, then find Id, or use the Username - e.g where `Username = 'email@domain.com'`)

## How do I import product pictures?

The pictures filename path must be relative to the host file system;  not your local PC/browser. On the admin>products page, select one product that has a picture, and then do an "Export to Excel (selected)".  Look at the Excel sheet.  Note the host path for the picture.  You will need to prefix your filenames with that path when creating the CSV file.   Don't use the exact path.  You need to create a temp folder up a level or two, and put your files in that temp folder.  If hosted, you will need to FTP the image files prior to import.
