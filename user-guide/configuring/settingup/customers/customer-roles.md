# Customer roles

The customer roles in nopCommerce enable you to form groups of your web-store users. You can create various groups such as store admins, shoppers, [vendors](xref:user-guide/configuring/settingup/customers/vendors/index), and other. You can also grant these groups certain rights such as discounted pricing, and other special statuses (such as tax exemption, free shipping, and more) using Access Control List.

**To add customer roles:**

Go to **Customers â†’ Customer Roles.** The Customer Roles window is displayed:
